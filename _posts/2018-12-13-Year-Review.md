This has been a year of extraordinary growth for me, in multiple areas. During this year, I had my first job in machine learning, I began my first relationship (which continues to go strong), I started taking piano lessons and chess lessons, and I (in the next few days) completed my grad school applications. Oh also, I started this blog. So with this in mind, I thought this would be a good time to reflect on what has happened for me in the past year, and what I'm looking forward to in the next year.

### New Years Resolutions 2018

Every year I make New Years Resolutions, so I think this is a good place to start. I had 3 resolutions for this year:

1. Become 1800 rated in chess
2. Learn to play piano
3. Start live stream coding

I'd say I've accomplished playing piano the best. I took lessons for 10 months of the year, and I have seen myself become a beginner player! I learned two songs: Daydreamin' by Radiohead, and Solfeggieto by Ph. E. Bach. For chess, though I've played a good bit, and taken lessons, I am not yet 1800. I'm hoping to attend more tournaments next year though and achieve this goal. For live stream coding, I tried it but ended up not pursuing it. It was a fun activity, but other personal goals and work just ended up taking the forefront. We'll see if I end up picking this up again though.

### Netra

Working at Netra was basically all I could ask for in my first machine learning job. As is the case at many startups, I managed to get my hands on a variety of tasks. I added 500 classes to Netra's logo detection model, I wrote code to speed up the training time for that model, and streamline processes, I created a demo and used it to teach people about Netra's API, and much more. Most importantly though, I was treated as an equal member of the team by everyone who worked at Netra. If I thought we could do something better, my co-workers listened to me and we tried to implement changes.

In terms of technical expertise, I learned a lot at Netra. My work at Netra was my first foray into Deep Learning. Learning about Deep Learning made me believe the hype to an extent. Though Deep Learning gives us the ability to have computers automate tasks we never thought would be possible, it also has a huge list of issues that need to be tackled. Reliability of dataset labeling, overfitting, and adversarial machine learning are just some issues that could derail these algorithms in the future. Nevertheless, I definitely see Deep Learning as a big part of the future of AI, and I am looking forward to seeing where it goes.

### First Girlfriend

I know this isn't exactly what is expected from a "techincal blog", but I am in my first ever long term relationship, and I think it has shaped my year in a lot of ways. One of the key takeaways for me is that I do not communicate nearly as clearly as I thought I did. On more than one occasion, what I thought I had told my girlfriend, and what she heard were completely different things. This is mainly due to the fact that sometimes I assume that other people know what I'm thinking, even though there is no good reason this would be the case. Improving my communication will be beneficial to me both in my relationships and in the work place, so I'm very happy she has helped me realize this.

Other than learning to communicate better, having a significant other is generally a good learning experience. You get to know someone almost as well as you know yourself, and it can change your opinion on a lot of things. 10/10 would do again ðŸ˜ƒ.

### Fall Semester 2018

This fall has been **the hardest** semester I've had at Northeastern. I made the grave mistake of trying to take 4 computer science/data science classes while applying to grad school, taking piano and chess lessons, and trying to have some semblance of a social life. Predictably, something had to be dropped, so I decided for now I would decrease my focus on chess, though I'm looking forward to picking it back up soon! 

This semester went about as well as it could have, though it was extremely stressful. I don't think my grades were as good as they could have been, but given the circumstances, I'm happy with where things ended up. To be frank though, I'm goddamn exhausted, and so I'm really looking forward to Christmas Break. I don't think I've taken a day off from working for 3 months, and some days I worked 14 hours. I'm not saying this in a "I'm feeling sorry for myself way", but I really want anyone who is reading this to understand what made this semester so difficult for me. Yes other people go through more difficult things, but whatever. This semester was hard, I'm proud of myself for getting through it, I never want to do something like this again.

### New Years Resolutions 2019

I'm a strong believer in work life balance, even though I haven't exactly been living out that belief of late. So, next year, all my resolutions will **not** be around becoming a better programmer, or getting better at Data Science. They will all be about being happier, as that's what really matters. So here is what they are so far:

1. Do not work at all at least 1 day a week.
2. Maintain a clean room at all times.
3. Find some form of meditation that works for you (isolation tank, running again if not injured, actual meditation).

I'm open to other suggestions, so feel free to reach out if you have some.

### Time's Arrow Marches On

Thankfully, no matter what, time keeps moving. 2018 has brought me a lot of things, good and bad, and I'm really looking forward to 2019. I have no idea what next year has in store, so we'll see what happens. To anyone reading this, I hope you have a happy new year.
