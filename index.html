	  <p> My name is <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>. I grew up in New York City, and am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Peacock.</p>
	  <p> I want to use Data Science to make the world a better place. Artificial Intelligence is a transformative technology that is rapidly changing how the world works, which makes it all the more important that those who design AI systems are mindful of its impacts. In my free time, I am working towards becoming a master level chess player.
