	  <p> My name is <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>. I grew up in New York City, and am currently in my final semester of my MS in Data Science at Northeastern University.</p>
	  <p> I want to use my Data Science skills to make the world a better place. Artificial Intelligence is a transformative technology that is rapidly changing how the world works, which makes it all the more important that those who design AI systems are mindful of their impacts. In my free time I like to play chess, bike, run, and watch cooking videos on youtube.
