		<h5><strong>Titanic Survival Problem</strong> - Created a model for the Titanic Survival Problem on Kaggle that predicted with 79.4% accuracy. See the kernel <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ospohngellert/titanic-kernel-79-4-accuracy/' style='font-weight: bold;'>here</a>. This was a first project for me, so in the future I'll look to improve on this when I have more experience.</h5>

		<h5><strong>Genre Classification by Lyrics</strong> - I currently have achieved a best case of 72% accuracy on artists I have already trained on, and 62% accuracy on new artists. My current next steps are more data collection, rethinking features, and attempting computationally inefficient methods (like k-fold cross validation). Follow my progress <a href='https://github.com/spohngellert-o/genre_classification'>here</a>.</h5>
